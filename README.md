# De-Dead Zone - Ben Ryves 2019

This reduces the size of the dead zone on the Sega Dreamcast Race Controller to improve its performance.

The circuit can be inserted between the stock 100K potentiometer and controller PCB and mounted inside the wheel for an invisible, non-destructive, reversible, modification.

To enable the dead zone size reduction hold the wheel to the left when switching the console on. To disable the dead zone size reduction hold the wheel to the right when switching the console on. The dead zone setting will be remembered when the console is switched off so if you leave the wheel in a central position when switching the console on it will use the last used setting.
